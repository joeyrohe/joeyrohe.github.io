    <p>I am a Junior at Coronado high school. I enjoy philosophy and watching YouTube videos. I am far too lazy to do extra curriculars</p>
    <p>My favorite hobby is collecting watches(I have far too many). I also enjoy video games(PC Master race), and building computers.</p>
    <p>I am a humanist, a skeptic, and an atheist. I used to live in Kentucky, and I grew up in New York. I have 7 siblings. I am the youngest.</p>
    <p>Next year, I plan on continuing on my AP class grind as a senior at CHS. I've scheduled APES, Rotc, AP Bio, AP Gov, AP Lit, and spanish.</p>
